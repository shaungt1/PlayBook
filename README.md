**Why I Wrote This:**

It was my intention to write this book so that I would always have a reference to the various code and engineering problems I solved and spent time learning. This is also a reference to many things I learned in school or working in tech. Furthermore, I found myself spending hours researching something, solving the problem, only to have to find the same information again a few weeks or months later. Therefore, I created this code journal to keep track of all the information. This is just my Journal.

**The problems with code documentation:**

There is a problem with online documentation and code references in that there is often unnecessary fluff and bloated descriptions. Alternatively, there may be very vague information that leaves you uncertain of what to do. Setting up and calling an API endpoint, looping through object keys, or implementing a search algorithm does not require knowledge of the history of the first microchip in the 1960s.



This documentation has been carefully crafted to cut through the BS and present code, algorithms or patterns that are easy to set up and execute with just the information you need, so you will not have any questions. For my part, I wrote this for my own personal use. It was written intentionally for my own use, whether it is for my daily work, personal projects, or interview experiences. However, I am pleased to share it with you and hope that you find it useful.

**Structure of this gitbook:**

* Code is categorized based on programming langauge
* Code and resource are random
* Feel free to reach out to me for suggestion you have or things you would like to see in the book.
