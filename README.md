### **Interview Questions:** <a href="#_xloijqnol6wd" id="_xloijqnol6wd"></a>

The following are actual interview challenges that I had to face. This is a list of interview questions and my answers to them. What follows is a description of what the challenge is and how I solved it. I found that these are typical some of these I have taken more than once. Hence why I find the need to add it to the journal.

_I worked on them using a variety of programming languages ranging from JavaScript, React, Java, and Python._

* Return the 3rd largest number from a set / list of random numbers
* Fibonacci algorithm
* Recursive Fibonacci algorithm
* Call an API Asynchronously using fetch
* Call an API Asynchronously use fetch to iterate through list of users and return first 3 users and their data
* â€¦
